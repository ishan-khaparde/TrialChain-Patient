Welcome to the Trailchain Patient Mobile application

This application was built to serve as front end for the patients who would interact with the system. The Trailchain project is built to provide an auditable trail of health records, and manage patient's participation in clinical trails. The patients can use the application to :
 1) View the records added by the doctor / hospital staff
 2) Consent to the use of their records and participate in clinical trials.
 3) Communicate with the doctor / hospital staff in case of queries and concerns.

The application uses an instance of the IBM Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to keep a tamper proof record of the EHR (Electronic Health Records).
